            <li>Proves the completeness of First-Order Predicate Logic in his doctoral dissertation.</li>
            <li>Proves the monumentally influential Incompleteness Theorem at the age of 25, forever changing the face of Logic</li>
            <li>Proves that Intuitionistic not finitely-valued in 1932</li>
            <li>Proves that Intuitionistic Logic is intepretable in Sytem S4 of Modal Logic in 1933</li>

          <p>"Kurt Gödel's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental – indeed it is more than a monument, it is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time. ... The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with Gödel's achievement."</p>
          <p>- Jon Von Neumann</p>
